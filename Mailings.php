				    <p>Dear MUN Advisor,</p>
					<p>We are happy to announce that our registration application will open at 8am PST today, <strong>September 14, 2015</strong>. You can go to our website and find our registration application under the “Advisors” tab or go directly to <a href="huxley.bmun.org">Huxley</a>. A step-by-step guideline for the registration process can be found on the Advisor Guide. In addition, a full list of our committees can be viewed on our website under the “BMUN LXIV” tab, here, and questions about committees can be answered by viewing our Advisor FAQs page here.</p>
					<p>As since BMUN 62, we will continue to perform registration on a first-come, first-serve basis. In other words, the earlier that a team registers, the higher its chances of receiving its preferred country assignments. This is to accommodate a growing constituency of teams and delegates from around the globe</p>
					<p>For BMUN LXIV, we have decided to adopt a new payment policy and a new system of releasing country assignments. After a team registers on Huxley, advisors will receive a confirmation email along with an invoice for the team fee. This non-refundable team fee must be paid by all teams by <strong>October 16th</strong>. Teams will then be notified of their registration status--whether they are on the registration list or wait list--by <strong>October 26th</strong>. Methods of payment can be found in the payment methods section of the Advisor Guide. If a team on the registration list fails to pay their team fee by <strong>October 16th</strong>, they will be dropped to the top of the waitlist. Please keep in mind that paying the team fee early while your team is still on the waitlist will not move your team up or out of the waitlist, unless a spot on the registration list opens from a late payment from a registered team. This may cause a delay on viewing country assignments since this year we are releasing country assignments in rounds instead of on a rolling basis. In the instance that we are unable to accommodate a team, the team fee will be fully refunded. For more detailed information on our new country assignment system and payment policy, please refer to the Advisor Guide.</p>
					<p>A timeline of our important dates, including when the first round of country assignments will be released, is available on our website.</p>
					<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@bmun.org" target="_blank">info@bmun.org</a>.</p>

					<p>Thank you, and we look forward to having you at BMUN LXIV.</p>

				    <p>Dear MUN Advisor,</p>
					<p>Registration for the sixty-third session of Berkeley Model United Nations is now closed, as we have reached our full capacity. However, that's not to say that your team can't still participate! With regular registration closed, we will now open up our waitlist registration. As currently registered teams change their number of delegates, spots will start opening up again, and we will take in waitlisted teams in the order that they registered. As such, if your group would still like to attend. we encourage you to register as soon as possible, as spots are filling up fast and continuing to fill up.</p>
					<p>If you would like to be on the waitlist, please head to our website, www.bmun.org, and click the “Advisor” tab for all the relevant information.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The <a href="http://www.huxley.bmun.org">“Registration”</a> link will take you to our registration application, Huxley, and you only need to click the green button labelled “Register for BMUN” and fill in the appropriate information. If you have any questions at all during this process, please email me at info@bmun.org! I would be more than happy to assist in any way that I can.</li>
						<li>The <a href="Advisor_FAQs.php">“Advisor FAQs”</a> page will help in clarifying any questions you may have about registration, payment, and the conference itself!</li>
						<li>Finally, the <a href="Timeline.php">“Timeline”</a> page will provide you an outline of the schedule for the rest of the year. It includes dates and deadlines for important materials, such as mailings, assignment finalizations, and position paper deadlines.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>We have also prepared an <a href="img/Advisor_Guide.pdf">Advisor Guide</a> for those advisors who are new to the MUN program, would like to learn more about our registration process, or learn about Berkeley Model United Nations in general!

					<p>Thank you again for registering your school for the this year's Berkeley Model United Nations. We are so honored that you will be one of the 72 teams joining us in entering BMUN's sixty-third session.

					<p>Topic synopses and country assignments have both been completed.

				  <div class="panel-body">
				    <p>Dear MUN Advisor,</p>
					<p>On behalf of the BMUN Secretariat, I am pleased to announce that our annual Alumni Scholarship is now available!</p>
					<p>One of the many things that Berkeley Model United Nations prides itself on is being one of the most affordable, competitive MUN conference around the world. We firmly believe that students everywhere should be given the opportunity to succeed regardless of their financial background. As such, one way that we seek to support these students is by providing an annual scholarship called the Alumni Scholarship. The BMUN Secretariat dedicates part of its funds to pay for the costs of attending the conference. Each application will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and will either partially or fully fund the delegate’s trip to the conference.  </p>
					<p>Delegates can access the application either on our website or directly download it by clicking <a href="img/BMUN_Alumni_Scholarship.pdf">here</a>. This year, more than ever before, BMUN is equipped to provide students who attend BMUN with need-based scholarships. We encourage you to share this information with your delegates for them to apply for the BMUN Alumni Scholarship! The deadline to apply is January 31st, 2015, and scholarship winners will be notified on February 7th.</p>
					<p>As always, if there any questions please do not hesitate to email me at info@bmun.org!</p>

				    <p>Dear MUN Advisor,</p>
					<p>Happy holidays from the Secretariat of Berkeley Model United Nations! We hope you and everyone at your school have been having a wonderful winter. This mailing details some important deadlines as well as information about blogs, the International Students Reception, and position papers.</p>
					<p>First and foremost, we require all teams to finalize their delegate number by January 24th. Please follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1s83hT3Y7c9DlOi9y_dW7aPjAJ9XMNvaZz-Pbi5YyFnE/viewform">this link</a> to fill out the appropriate information and submit your assignment finalization. Any teams that do not complete the form by the deadline will face forfeiture of their assignments. Following January 24th, teams will no longer be able to change their assignments. Teams understand that they are financially liable for all of the assignments they indicate on the form. For each delegate a team does not bring past the deadline, it will receive no greater than a $10 refund. We cannot stress enough the importance of filling out the Assignment Finalization form on time. As such, we encourage advisors to submit their numbers as early as possible.</p>
					<p>Second, the form to submit position papers is now open! The link to the form is available in this mailing <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/bmun.org/forms/d/1wV_dqEJqcJ8a1fvmXeJ1dvJEAR1VCuaQiufW6nQIaHE/viewform">here</a>, and it will also be available on our website very soon. A reminder that the format for position papers is different this year, and we encourage your delegates to read over the <a href="img/Position_Paper_Rubric.pdf">Position Paper Grading Rubric</a> and our <a href="img/Delegate_Welcome_Letter.pdf">USG of Research’s letter</a> with further details. The first position paper deadline is February 1st,  for delegates to be eligible for research and general committee awards. The second deadline is February 11th for just committee award eligibility. </p>
					<p>Along the same vein, I am happy to announce that our famous committee blogs are now up! Blogs are something that has distinguished Berkeley Model United Nations from other MUN conferences around the world and have been repeatedly praised by advisors and delegates alike for its innovative nature. Each committee is responsible for maintaining a blog by regularly posting a variety of things to contribute to the committee, and delegates respond to the posts by commenting. Some examples of posts in the past have been case studies of particular countries affected by the topic, current event articles, and character profiles. Not only do they give delegates an opportunity for further research and keep updated on their topics, they also provide a platform for delegates to acquaint with one another before conference even starts and a digital bridge linking the chairs and delegates. We highly encourage all delegates to participate, as blogs have often contributed to shaping debate on the weekend of conference, and because they are also very helpful resources. Committee blogs can be found by typing in COMMITTEE ACRONYM.blogs.bmun.org (eg. For 1st Disarmament and International Security (DISC), the link would be disc.blogs.bmun.org). Links to the blogs will be up on our website very shortly, but in the meanwhile <a href="img/Committee_Acronyms.pdf">here is a list of committee acronyms</a> to help your delegates find their blogs. The first post will be up on January 2nd!</p>
					<p>For international teams, the Berkeley Model United Nations team has prepared an International Student Reception on the Friday of conference weekend, February 27th, 2015. We welcome all international teams to come and participate, as we have many activities planned such as a campus tour, a seminar hosted by a UC Berkeley Admissions Officer, and a BMUN procedure workshop. This reception is completely free of charge and snacks and refreshments will be provided. More details will follow very shortly! </p>
					<p>And finally, a reminder that the Alumni Scholarship deadline is January 24th. As detailed in the previous mailing, please inform your team that any delegates that require financial assistance in attending the sixty-third session of BMUN should apply! </p>
					<p>As always, if there any questions please do not hesitate to email me at info@bmun.org!</p>

				  <div class="panel-body">
				    <p>Dear MUN Advisor,</p>
					<p>Thank you all for submitting your finalized delegation numbers in by the deadline. This mailing contains important information including delegate names submission and liability waivers.</p>
					<p>First, we would like to remind all teams that the Alumni Scholarship deadline is January 31st! We sincerely encourage any and all delegates who might need financial assistance in attending our conference to apply. Applications can be either submitted to treasurer@bmun.org by 11:59 PST on January 31st or mailed to our PO Box, postmarked by January 31st. </p>
					<p>In addition, the deadlines to submit position papers are rapidly approaching as well. For both research and committee award eligibility, delegates must submit their papers in by February 1st. For just committee award eligibility, delegates must submit their papers in by February 11th. The link for delegates to submit their position papers can be found on our website, under the “Delegates” tab along with the position paper guidelines. Some committees have a different style of position paper submission, such as some of the Crisis committees, and head chairs have notified the delegates of the differences through their blogs.</p>
					<p>On that note, we strongly encourage all teams to regularly check on and participate in our committee blogs! Links for each committee’s blog can be found on our website, under the “BMUN LXIII” tab in the “Committees” page. Head chairs will be posting some very important and relevant information for delegates, and, as such, it is recommended that all delegates follow along.</p>
					<p>And now, two very important, mandatory deadlines. First, we ask that you submit delegate names for each assignment. This must be completed by February 6th. Please follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1s0v4uEJC28KC7BcDz4lVkyhrk88vjD39Fxfv-9AgYSQ/viewform">this link</a> to submit your delegate names. And secondly, all delegates must fill out a liability form in order to attend our conference. Similar to last year, we will be having our forms available to fill out online by following this link. Forms must be submitted by February 13th, or delegates risk unable to attend the sixty-third session of Berkeley Model United Nations.</p>
					<p>Thank you very much, and, as always, if there any questions or concerns please email us at info@bmun.org.</p>
