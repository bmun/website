This coming 63rd session is comprised of a diverse array of twenty committees, including the bilingual <i>Inter-American Development Bank</i>, <i>Interpol</i>, and the return of our very own <i>Press Corps</i> committee.</p>
					<p>Attached are links to three documents for your perusal:</p>

				    <p>Dear MUN Advisor,</p>
					<p>We are happy to announce that our registration application is now officially open. You can go to our website and find our registration application under the ‘Advisors’ tab. A full list of our committees can be viewed on our website also, <a href="Committees.php">here</a>, and questions about committees can be answered by viewing our Advisor FAQs page <a href="Advisor_FAQs.php">here</a>.</p>
					<p>This year at BMUN, we will be performing registration on a first-come-first serve basis. In other words, as soon as a school registers, they will be automatically assigned countries and spots in specialized committees based on the preferences they indicate on the registration page. This is to accommodate a growing constituency of schools and delegates from around the globe and to provide all schools with a fair opportunity to get the spots they want.</p>
					<p>A timeline of our important dates, including when the first round of country assignments will be released, is available on our website <a href="Timeline.php">here</a>.</p>

					<p>Thank you, and we look forward to having you at BMUN LXIII.</p>
