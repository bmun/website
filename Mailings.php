				    <p>Dear MUN Advisor,</p>
					<p>We are happy to announce that our registration application is now officially open. You can go to our website and find our registration application under the ‘Advisors’ tab. A full list of our committees can be viewed on our website, and questions about committees can be answered by viewing our Advisor FAQs page.</p>
					<p>This year at BMUN, we will be performing registration on a first-come-first serve basis. In other words, as soon as a school registers, they will be automatically assigned countries and spots in specialized committees based on the preferences they indicate on the registration page. This is to accommodate a growing constituency of schools and delegates from around the globe and to provide all schools with a fair opportunity to get the spots they want.</p>
					<p>A timeline of our important dates, including when the first round of country assignments will be released, is available on our website.</p>

					<p>Thank you, and we look forward to having you at BMUN LXIII.</p>

				    <p>Dear MUN Advisor,</p>
					<p>Registration for the sixty-third session of Berkeley Model United Nations is now closed, as we have reached our full capacity. However, that's not to say that your team can't still participate! With regular registration closed, we will now open up our waitlist registration. As currently registered teams change their number of delegates, spots will start opening up again, and we will take in waitlisted teams in the order that they registered. As such, if your group would still like to attend. we encourage you to register as soon as possible, as spots are filling up fast and continuing to fill up.</p>
					<p>If you would like to be on the waitlist, please head to our website, www.bmun.org, and click the “Advisor” tab for all the relevant information.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The “Registration” link will take you to our registration application, Huxley, and you only need to click the green button labelled “Register for BMUN” and fill in the appropriate information. If you have any questions at all during this process, please email me at info@bmun.org! I would be more than happy to assist in any way that I can.</li>
						<li>The “Advisor FAQs” page will help in clarifying any questions you may have about registration, payment, and the conference itself!</li>
						<li>Finally, the “Timeline” page will provide you an outline of the schedule for the rest of the year. It includes dates and deadlines for important materials, such as mailings, assignment finalizations, and position paper deadlines.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>We have also prepared an Advisor Guide for those advisors who are new to the MUN program, would like to learn more about our registration process, or learn about Berkeley Model United Nations in general! We hope you’ll find this guide useful in some way.</p>

					<p>Thank you, and we hope to see you for BMUN 63!</p>
