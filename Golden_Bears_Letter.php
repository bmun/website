        <p>Dear Advisors & Delegates,</p>
        
        <p>Thank you again for your participation at our conference! We hope you enjoyed your time at the biggest BMUN Conference to date. The officers and secretariat are already beginning to prepare for the BMUN 63 conference and are looking forward to seeing you back at UC Berkeley next March. </p>
        <p>Congratulations to all graduating senior delegates! For those of you who will be attending UC Berkeley in the Fall, we would like to encourage you to apply to join our organization on campus. Berkeley Model United Nations is a great way to continue your participation in MUN while in college. As a member of BMUN, you will be responsible for chairing a committee and get to experience running a conference for over 1500 high school students from all over the world. You will be part of a team of about 70 people that help to continue the oldest MUN conference in the world! There are many opportunities to take on leadership positions, network with an extensive alumni association, and even chair conferences in China and India. Most importantly, BMUN is a close-knit group of friends that will provide you with a family away from home as you are adjusting to life as a Berkeley student. </p>
        <p>Recruitment for BMUN takes place in the first three weeks of the semester; look out for us all over campus to get all the details! Applications will be found at <a href="index.php">www.bmun.org</a>. If you have any questions, please email me at <a href="mailto:chief@bmun.org" target="_blank">chief@bmun.org</a>. We look forward to seeing you in the Fall!  </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
