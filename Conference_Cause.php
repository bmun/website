                <p>We are thrilled to announce that BMUN has partnered with Teach for All in an effort to raise awareness about our 63rd conference cause, the global education crisis. As an MUN conference that focuses specifically on educating its delegates, we are all very passionate about this issue. The education crisis effects every member of our Secretariat, every delegate at our conference, every student at UC Berkeley, and every member of the global community. Part two of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals includes achieving universal primary education all around the world by 2015. Unfortunately, despite impressive strides forward at the beginning of the decade, progress in reducing the number of children out of school has slackened considerably. BMUN and Teach for All hope to reverse this trend by educating our delegates about the importance of this issue, and providing them with the tools they need to help make a difference.</p>
