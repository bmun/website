        <p>The BMUN Secretariat is committed to ensuring that no delegate is excluded from BMUN due to financial constraints. As such, our Alumni Scholarship allocates $7,000 of financial aid to low-income students. Individual delegates can apply for this assistance to cover part of the cost of attending BMUN, including delegate fees, transportation, and hotel costs. For the BMUN 64, we have significantly increased the scholarship amounts. All students in need are strongly encouraged to apply.</p>
        <p>The financial aid is need-based for expenses directly related to the conference, transportation, hotel, and registration fees. In this application we ask for personal information regarding your finances that we believe will help us to determine the financial aid required for each applicant. We therefore ask that you provide proof of need in all applicable areas to increase your chances of receiving financial aid. All information will be treated with utmost confidentiality and will be used only for financial aid purposes.</p>
        <p>In order for your scholarship application to be considered complete, both the student application and the School Advisor Recommendation form must be submitted by <strong>December 21, 2015</strong> in order to be considered for financial aid.</p>
        <p>The Alumni Scholarship Application can be accessed <a href="https://goo.gl/7nZZNI">HERE</a> </p>
        <p>The School Advisor Recommendation can be accessed <a href="https://goo.gl/r3TztN">HERE</a> </p>
