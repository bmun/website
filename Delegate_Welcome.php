        <hr>

        <p>Dear Delegates,</p>
        <p>Welcome to the 63rd Annual Berkeley Model United Nations Conference (BMUN). My name is Kevin Kai, and I have the privilege to serve as your Under-Secretary General of Research for the weekend. As USG of Research, I have created and am overseeing the 20 committees at BMUN 63. This February, you and 1,800 other students will amalgamate at the world’s number one public university, the University of California at Berkeley to form the largest Model United Nations conference in the United States. This microcosm of individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences will surely serve to make this an unforgettable weekend.</p>
        <p>Above all, our goal is to ensure that our delegates leave BMUN having had an enriched educational experience and a great time while maintaining our tradition of having a competitive conference. In following with this model, I have made several changes to Position Papers.</p>
        <p>Regarding Position Papers, I have changed the components of them to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Country’s Relationship/History to the Topic</li>
            <li>Solutions for the Topic</li>
            <li>Response to 2 Questions to Consider of the Delegate’s Choice</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I have also changed the guidelines for them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Maximum of 5 pages per topic</li>
            <li>Double-spaced</li>
            <li>12 point font in Times New Roman</li>
            <li>1-inch margins</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are two reasons why I have changed the format of the Position Papers. First, it removes any opportunity for plagiarism. In the past, BMUN has found that it is easy for delegates to copy from the Topic Synopses from Head Chairs. Therefore, I made the components unique to each country to remove this threat. Second, this format emphasizes the more important of the Position Paper,the solutions. I want our delegates to exercise their creative thinking and show a solid grasp of the topic beyond their nation’s relationship to it or what is apparent in the current news. I know that our delegates can handle this new format, and I am looking forward to see how they rise to the challenge.We will also release the Position Paper grading rubric that shows a heavy weight on solutions.</p>
        <p> I have placed a 5-page maximum per topic to urge delegates to be concise with their writing. As I progress through college and beyond, I continually realize that professors and colleagues prefer concise reports instead of overly thorough ones. I hope to help prepare delegates for college and beyond by getting them acquainted with such restrictions.</p>
        <p>Besides creating new guidelines, I have also created unique committees that encompass a variety of areas of debate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interpol</li>
            <li>International Labour Organization</li>
            <li>Inter-American Development Bank (Bilingual Spanish)</li>
            <li>United Nationals Global Compact</li>
            <li>International Financial Corporations Crisis</li>
            <li>Atlantic City Conference</li>
            <li>Genghis Khan’s Military Dynasty</li>
            <li>Press Corps</p>
        </ul>
        <p>Each BMUN committee will explore their respective topics to come to a consensus on the optimal solutions and actions. There may even be some coordination between different committees to incorporate multilateral aspects of the topics. Regulation of antibiotic administration, currency wars, prohibition, and the Chinese Civil War are some of the convoluted topics that will be discussed during conference weekend.</p>
        <p>I have no doubt that your participation will create a better experience for all participating delegates and chairs. Having been a chair with BMUN for the last 3 years, I guarantee that I always end conference with new knowledge from the delegates. I encourage each and every one of you to continue participating in Model United Nations events and think about how you can incorporate these skills outside of conferences.</p>
        <p>On behalf of the Berkeley Model United Nations Secretariat, I wish you all the best in your preparation for BMUN and during conference weekend. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:research@bmun.org" target="_blank">research@bmun.org</a>. I look forward to meeting all of you during BMUN 63!</p>
        <p>Best Regards,</p>
