		    		<ul>
		    			<li><strong>Interpol (ICPO)</strong> <br>
		    			INTERPOL is the world’s largest international police organization, with 190 ﻿	member countries. Its role is to enable police around the world to work together to make the world a safer place. Its high-tech infrastructure of technical and operational support helps meet the growing challenges of fighting crime in the 21st century. <small> Source: <a href="http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Overview"> Interpol </a> </small>
		    			</li> <br>

		    			<li><strong>Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</strong> <br>
		    			The FAO aims to eradicate hunger and malnutrition, promote global economic and social progress, and facilitate sustainable management of natural resources. As poverty and hunger persist and the international community recognizes the dire state of our land, water, and air, it is clear the FAO has an extensive agenda to address. This committee will honor the International Year of Soils through its discussion of Sustainable Land Management, and address the FAO's fundamental inequities and structural inefficiencies in its discussion of Food Insecurity: Challenges to the FAO's Guiding Framework.
		    			<small> Source: <a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/"> FAO </a> </small>
		    			</li> <br>

		    			<li><strong>International Labor Organization (ILO)</strong> <br>
		    			The International Labour Organization (ILO) is devoted to promoting social justice and internationally recognized human and labour rights, pursuing its founding mission that labour peace is essential to prosperity. Today, the ILO helps advance the creation of decent work and the economic and working conditions that give working people and business people a stake in lasting peace, prosperity and progress. Its tripartite structure provides a unique platform for promoting decent work for all women and men. Its main aims are to promote rights at work, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue on work-related issues.

		    			</li> <br>

		    			<li><strong>International Criminal Court (ICC)</strong> <br>
		    			The International Criminal Court (ICC) is an independent, permanent court that tries persons accused of the most serious crimes of international concern, namely genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. ICC is a specialized committee that runs very similar to a court. There are two sides to an argument being presented by two lawyers (our dais), the head chair serves as the mediator, and the delegates rule on the verdict after a long weekend of hearing witnesses for both sides. This committee is meant to advance students understanding of international law.

		    			</li> <br>

		    			<li><strong>United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)</strong> <br>
		    			The United Nations Global Compact is the largest strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with areas not directly related to business (environment, labor rights, human rights, corruption, etc.). There are both business and non-business participants in UNGC to help facilitate the implementation of successful and socially responsible business practices. The UNGC works closely with other United Nations agencies to ensure the universal adoption of its policies and to garner multilateral support.

		    			</li> <br>

		    			<li><strong>Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</strong> <br>
		    			The IDB is a bilingual committee that focuses on decreasing inequality and poverty through sustainable solutions, including loans, grants, and research, in the Latin American and the Caribbean regions. Our committee stresses measurable results to the countries being served through integrity, transparency, and accountability. The two topics we will be focusing on are: International Financial Institutions as methods to assist development projects in English, and Technology in development, in Spanish.

		    			</li> <br>

		    			<li><strong>Press Corps (PRESS)</strong> <br>
						While not a new committee, the Press Corps was taken out in 62 and has been re-introduced back for BMUN 63. Press Corps is a committee that is entirely different than any other committee at BMUN.  Students act as reporters, journalists, photographers and artists, rather than representing countries like in a normal committee. Their task is to gather information from other committees in written or visual form and write articles to be displayed for the entire conference to see.
		    			</li> <br>

		    			<li><strong>Atlantic City Conference (ACC)</strong> <br>
						The ACC is a simulation of the historic summit that brought together leaders of organized crime in the United States. Considered by many historians as the first meeting of its type, it had an immense impact on the future of the criminal underworld and served as a precursor to the National Crime Syndicate.
		    			</li> <br>

		    			<li><strong>Genghis Khan's Military Dynasty (KHAN)</strong> <br>
						The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest and most far reaching empires, ruling from the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea. This expansion took place due to great military tactics and the ruling power of Genghis Khan. In this committee, we will rewrite history and begin back in 1206 right when Genghis Khan came to power. We will see how Genghis and his War Council will do with new threats and new enemies. 
		    			</li> <br>

		    			<li><strong>International Finance Corporation (IFC)</strong> <br>
						Every year the IFC works with governments, businesses, other multilateral organizations, and foundations in promoting innovative projects to address extreme poverty and foster development. In this committee, delegates will have the chance of representing national development agencies, regional development banks, ministers of finance, and directors of private companies and foundations to engage in collaborative and fast-paced discussion. IFC will focus in addressing foreign investment promotion in fragile and conflict-affected situations as well as the creation of public-private partnerships that help governments achieve long-term economic growth and better living standards.

		    	<dd>Berkeley is the third greenest city in America. All around us, institutions are making efforts to reduce paper and water waste. BMUN believes in living the principles we espouse, and that is why we have undertaken the going green initiative in the 57th session and continued to uphold this initiative. Our conference will be going waste-neutral by reducing paper waste via online submission of position papers and projected (rather than printed) resolutions. Also, the staff will work to recycle and compost all waste produced by the conference.</dd>
