Shrey Goel,Secretary-General,"Environmental Science, Pre-Med",4th,"I was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and although I've been in the States longer than I was in Winnipeg, I like to pretend to be more Canadian than I am. I'm a Global Poverty and Practice minor, and as a Pre-Med Environmental Science student, I'm really interested in pursuing a career that integrates my interests in human health, poverty and development, and environmental health. "
Riyaz Shah,Chief of Staff,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,4th,"I am a senior majoring in EECS, and minoring in IEOR. Outside of BMUN I am also part of an organization called Berkeley Consulting. BC is a student-run management and strategy consulting organization where we consult for Fortune 500 companies, start-ups, non-profits, and everything in between. Besides BC, I enjoy spending time under the great Berkeley sun, playing Fifa, and learning more about the tech world. "

Hee Soo Kim,Under-Secretary General of External Relations,Political Economy,3rd,"I've been a part of the Model United Nations program for a total of almost 7 years now, 4 years as a delegate and 3 years as a chair for BMUN. I'm also the Secretary-General for the fifth session of Inter-Generational Model United Nations (IGMUN). Needless to say, I love MUN, and I try to give back as much as I have received from being a part of this great program. Outside of MUN, I'm also part of the Cal Dragon Boat team as a paddler and also its caller. But otherwise, I think I best like spending my free time reading comic books, sampling different types of tea, and keeping up with my favorite TV shows. "

Liz Zarka,Under Secretary General of Internal Relations,Philosophy and Political Science ,3rd,"Outside of BMUN, I love to read, discover new music, watch live comedy, tweet, karaoke, and discuss politics, culture and the meaning of the human condition with friends! Speaking of which, filling out this box is throwing me into some kind of existential tailspin. See you all in February! "
Nikhil Agarwal,Under-Secretary General of Logistics,Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology,4th,"I was born and raised on a tiny island in the Caribbean called Curacao, and I am now a fourth year premedical student here at UC Berkeley.

Emily Reece,Under-Secretary General of Special Events,Political Science,3rd,"Outside of BMUN I like to run, hike, play soccer, and eat (a lot). I'm also involved in the student programming board on campus known as SUPERB. We plan all sorts of events- comedy shows, concerts, trivia nights, film screenings- for students on campus. During the summers I work as a camp counselor at Gold Arrow Camp where I get to do a bunch of fun activities with a group of 12 year old girls all summer long. "
Gabi Espinoza,Under-Secretary General of Outreach,"Anthropology, Psychology",4th,"Outside of BMUN and classes, you can catch me in Tolman Hall working for the most wonderfully crotchety psychology professor emerita in the world, helping out with Jumpstart (non-profit for preschool literacy), writing copy for an interior design e-commerce site, or marathoning Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Netflix. Sometimes, I bake cookies."
Isabel Viegas de Lima,Under-Secretary General of Publications,Civil Engineering,3rd,"Born and educated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I came to the United States to attend college.

Outside of school and BMUN, I enjoy spending time with friends, baking, crafting, reading, and watching movies.

Jonas Majewski,Treasurer,Business and Economics,2nd,"I was born in Germany, but have lived in the Bay Area for over thirteen years now.  This past summer I visited Europe and interned for Ghirardelli Chocolate's Finance Department.  Outside of BMUN, I coach Speech & Debate for my old high school, attempt to keep up with my schoolwork, and watch absurd amounts of television.  I also enjoy anything outdoors-related, from backpacking to cycling and especially scuba diving. "
Sarah Yue,Historian,"Molecular and Cellular Biology, Economics",2nd,"I'm currently a sophomore pursuing a double major in MCB and Economics or Haas, depending on if I get in, so most of my time outside of BMUN is taken up by my studies. I am also a part of a sorority on campus so I enjoy participating in our philanthropy events and in general having an awesome set of girls to spend my time with. Other than that, I love watching TV shows, taking photos, and exploring SF!"
