        <p>Dear Advisors,</p>
        <p>Hello! I hope this message finds you well after a relaxing summer!</p>
        <p>My name is Benjamin (Benjy) Malings, and I am honored to be serving as the Under-Secretary General of Outreach for Berkeley Model United Nations’ 64th Session. In this role, I will be leading our outreach initiative that works with Bay Area schools to establish and develop their Model UN programs. BMUN’s outreach sessions consist of our Secretariat members visiting your school to work directly with your students to enhance their diplomacy skills and knowledge of international relations. You can sign up for these outreach sessions using the sign-up form found under the Outreach tab on our website or by simply sending me an email at <a href="outreach@bmun.org">outreach@bmun.org</a></p>
        <p>BMUN is excited to offer several different services with our sessions. We give a variety of presentations, including lessons on Model UN fundamentals and advanced committee procedure, as well as brief committee simulations. We are also able to provide consulting on organizing and hosting your own Model UN conference, as well as on building and expanding your program as a whole. In short, we are happy to be a resource for virtually all of your Model UN needs!</p>
        <p>Aside from outreach sessions, I am also honored to formally invite you to the Berkeley Model United Nations <strong>Delegate Workshop</strong>, which will be held on <strong>Saturday, November 14, 2015</strong>. The Delegate Workshop is an exciting opportunity for delegates to learn directly from our accomplished Secretariat the essential skills to excel in Model UN conferences. You may sign up for delegate workshop using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/bmun.org/forms/d/1k8YdZ1OEFu2jXVW2HuS7UAo-dRrzGyoT_n9agY61umg/viewform">form</a>.</p>
        <p>At delegate workshop, our available courses are separated into two categories- Novice and Advanced. In our Novice committees, delegates will spend the morning learning Model UN fundamentals, as taught by BMUN’s secretariat. Our Advanced classes will be placed into smaller groups, and will consist of a more open format, allowing for questions of greater detail and teaching in-depth Model UN procedures, with a focus on crisis committees.</p>
        <p>Both courses will be followed by a brief break for lunch (provided by BMUN), and then a committee simulation once delegates return to their classrooms. This short mock-conference will enable the delegates to put the skills they learned into practice, as well as to raise any additional inquiries they might have about procedure. During the Delegate Workshop, we will also hold an advisor meeting during which the advisors of participating schools will have the opportunity to meet one another, as well as the BMUN Secretariat. As with the BMUN Conference in March, the Delegate Workshop will be hosted on the campus of UC Berkeley. Further information regarding topics and committees will be made available to you in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>Berkeley Model United Nations will also continue its tradition to reward the most active and enthusiastic schools attending Delegate Workshop; we will be offering scholarships towards registration fees for our BMUN conference on March 4th to 6th, 2015 as an incentive for delegates to work diligently throughout the Workshop. </p>
        <p>I look forward to seeing you in November!</p>
