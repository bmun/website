        <p>Dear Advisors & Delegates,</p>
        <p>My name is Gabriella Espinoza, and I am honored to be serving as 
        the Under-Secretary General of Outreach for the 63rd Session of 
        Berkeley Model United Nations. I will thus be leading BMUNâ€™s outreach 
        initiative, which works to collaborate with local schools in order to 
        develop their Model United Nations programs. We at BMUN hope to enlighten 
        future generations with knowledge on international relations, encouraging 
        them to become more active and informed global citizens.</p>
        <p>As part of this outreach initiative, it is my privilege to invite you 
        to the BMUN Delegate Workshop in the Fall of 2014. This one-day workshop 
        is a fantastic opportunity for students to learn the necessary skills to 
        succeed at Model United Nations from our capable and knowledgeable Secretariat. 
        Throughout the day, we will be offering two different courses: the first focuses 
        on MUN fundamentals for new delegates, and the second is geared toward more 
        experienced delegates who wish to enhance their skills in diplomacy, debate, 
        and public speaking. Both courses will be followed by a brief break for lunch, 
        and then a committee simulation once delegates return to their classrooms. 
        This short mock-conference will enable the delegates to put the skills they 
        learned into practice and raise any questions they might have. As with the BMUN 
        Conference in March, the Delegate Workshop will be hosted on the campus of UC Berkeley.</p>
        <p>BMUN will also continue its tradition of rewarding the most active and 
        enthusiastic schools attending Delegate Workshop; we will be offering 
        scholarships towards registration fees for our March conference as an incentive 
        for delegates to work diligently throughout the Workshop. You can register for 
        our Delegate Workshop and our conference at our website (bmun.org). The registration 
        page for Delegate Workshop can be found under the Community Outreach tab, and 
        more details will be communicated as dates and logistics are finalized. </p>
        <p>You will also find on the Community Outreach tab the request page for 
        Outreach Sessions. In these Outreach Sessions, qualified members of the 
        Secretariat visit local high schools to teach the skills necessary to be a 
        successful delegate in MUN. Additionally, we are working to offer some new services 
        this year, particularly in helping local high schools set up and chair their own 
        conferences in order to expand the Bay Area MUN circuit. Furthermore, we hope to make 
        the resources used in these Outreach Sessions accessible online, so that they may be 
        found useful by schools located outside of Northern California.</p>
        <p> BMUN is excited to be working with you, and I look forward to seeing you in November! </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
