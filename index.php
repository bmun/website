                <p>Berkeley Model United Nations is a student run organization on the UC Berkeley campus 
                dedicated to continuing its six decades of excellence as the world’s premier — and very first 
                — United Nations simulation. Every March, over 1,500 high school students from all over the 
                world come to Berkeley to participate in Berkeley Model United Nations. Entering its 63rd 
                session, BMUN’s mission is to spread awareness of international issues and the spirit of 
                diplomacy through UN simulations. We also aim to create an educational experience for high 
                school student, to help them realize their potential in public speaking as well as policy debate. 
                We do this by serving as head chairs on a diverse group of committees in which we help to 
                facilitate delegate education through substantive diplomatic debate. </p>
