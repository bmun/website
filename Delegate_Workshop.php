        <p>Dear Advisors & Delegates,</p>
        
        <p>It is my privilege to invite you to the BMUN Delegate Workshop in the Fall of 2014. This one-day training workshop is a fantastic opportunity for students to learn the necessary skills to succeed at Model United Nations from our capable and knowledgeable Secretariat. </p>
        <p>Throughout the day, we will be offering two different courses. The first focuses on MUN fundamentals for new delegates, providing students with the essential tools to be a strong delegate. The second is geared toward more experienced delegates who wish to enhance their skills in diplomacy, debate, and public speaking, as well as to gain a better understanding of international relations. Both courses will be followed by a brief break for lunch, and then a committee simulation once delegates return to their classrooms. This short mock-conference will enable the delegates to put the skills they learned into practice, as well as to raise any additional questions they might have about procedure. As with the BMUN Conference in March, the Delegate Workshop will be hosted on the campus of UC Berkeley. </p>
        <p>During the Delegate Workshop, we will also hold an advisor meeting during which advisors will have the opportunity to meet other advisors as well as the BMUN Secretariat. </p>
        <p>BMUN will also continue its tradition of rewarding the most active and enthusiastic schools attending Delegate Workshop; we will be offering scholarships towards registration fees for our March conference as an incentive for delegates to work diligently throughout the Workshop. You can register for our Delegate Workshop and our conference at our website (bmun.org). The registration page for Delegate Workshop can be found under the Outreach tab. </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
