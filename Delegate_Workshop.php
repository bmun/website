        <p>Dear Advisors & Delegates,</p>

        <p>Hello! I am honored to formally invite you to the Berkeley Model United Nations Delegate Workshop, which will be held on Saturday, November 14, 2015. The Delegate Workshop is an exciting opportunity for delegates to learn directly from our accomplished Secretariat the essential skills to excel in Model UN conferences.</p>
        <p>At delegate workshop, committees are separated into two categories- Novice and Advanced. In our Novice committees, delegates will spend the morning learning Model UN fundamentals, as taught by BMUNâ€™s secretariat. Our Advanced classes will be placed into smaller groups, and will consist of a more open format, allowing for questions of greater detail and teaching in-depth Model UN procedures, with a focus on crisis committees.</p>
        <p>Our courses will be followed by a brief break for lunch (provided by BMUN) and a committee simulation once delegates return to their classrooms. This short mock-conference will enable the delegates to put the skills they learned into practice, as well as to raise any additional inquiries they might have about procedure. During the Delegate Workshop, we will also hold an advisor meeting during which the advisors of participating schools will have the opportunity to meet one another, as well as the BMUN Secretariat. As with the BMUN Conference in March, the Delegate Workshop will be hosted on the campus of UC Berkeley. Further information regarding topics and committees will be made available to you in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>This opportunity for a low-pressure yet highly realistic simulation of a Model UN conference, led by the very same chairs who will help run BMUN, is unparalleled in the Bay Area.</p>
        <p>Berkeley Model United Nations will also continue its tradition to reward the most active and enthusiastic schools attending Delegate Workshop; we will be offering scholarships towards registration fees for our BMUN conference on March 4th to 6th, 2015 as an incentive for delegates to work diligently throughout the Workshop.</p>
