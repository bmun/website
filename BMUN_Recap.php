                <p>As the preparation for BMUN LXIII begins, our secretariat takes a look at how far we've come and what we've accomplished. BMUN LXII brought back traditions but made many new strides as well. Our lovely head chairs ran committees with topics ranging from water security in the Americas in our Spanish bilingual committee, OAS, to our historical committee on Alexander the Great's War Council.</p>

                <p>As Berkeley's weather warmed, the school welcomed 1,600 students to its campus on the weekend of March 8-10, 2014. The first ever Rules and Procedures presentation was held during BMUN LXII's first day. Here, members of the BMUN secretariat delivered a fast-paced tutorial of parliamentary procedure to brush up eager delegates' skills for committee. </p>

                <p>Many committees had guest lecturers (Berkeley professors) come and show real-world applications of the committeeâ€™s topics. BMUN delegates were able to gain new insight on the impact of Model UN in the greater scope of things, as well as a break from the intense debate.</p>
