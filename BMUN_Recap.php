                <p>As the preparation for BMUN LXIII begins, our secretariat takes a look at how far we've 
                come. BMUN LXII brought back traditions but new strides as well. Our lovely head chairs 
                ran committees whose topics ranged from Water Security in the Americas in our Spanish 
                bilingual committee OAS, to a historical committee on Alexander the Great's War Council.</p>

                <p>As Berkeley's weather warmed, it also welcomed 1,600 students to its campus on the weekend 
                on March 8-10, 2014. The first Rules and Procedures presentation was held at BMUN LXII where 
                BMUN college members went through a summary of parliamentary procedure. </p>
