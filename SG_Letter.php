        <p>Dear Advisors & Delegates,</p>
        <p>It is my honor and privilege to formally invite you to the 63rd annual session 
        of Berkeley Model United Nations, to be held the weekend of <strong>February 27th to 
        March 1st, 2015</strong> on the University of California, Berkeley campus.</p>
        <p>As many of you may know, the BMUN Secretariat is comprised entirely of undergraduate 
        students at the University of California, Berkeley. UC Berkeley has a rich history 
        of eliciting passion and critical thought from its students. By putting a diverse 
        array of students together in a common space, and fueling them with ideas and 
        concepts from the world of academia, the campus has become a setting where students 
        can challenge and collaborate with each other to build solutions to the problems they 
        see. Similarly, for the past 62 years, since 1952, our organization has sought to do the 
        same with high school students. A BMUN committee room is a truly special setting where 
        our secretariat members serve as mentors for high school students to guide them through 
        the collaborative processes of diplomacy and high-level critical thinking about 
        international relations. </p>
        <p>As the oldest MUN conference in the world, and as a non-profit organization, we 
        seek to serve our community by making Model UN accessible and affordable to all students. 
        This year, we hope to serve even more students, not just through our prestigious conference, 
        which hosted 1440 students this past year, but also through our Outreach program, which 
        allows us to conduct workshops with local high schools and provide materials for schools 
        to teach their students how to participate in MUN. We also hope to expand our Alumni 
        Scholarship program to ensure that no student is excluded from participation in BMUN due 
        to financial limitations. </p>
        <p>BMUN 63 will offer 20 dynamic committees spanning a diverse array of the most 
        pressing international issues, from both historical and contemporary times. We will 
        as always host our traditional General Assembly committees. But this year we will also feature 
        committees such as the <em>Food and Agricultural Organization</em> and the 
        <em>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</em> to discuss the looming issues of food security 
        and environmental sustainability. We will also feature unique new committees such as 
        <em>Interpol</em> and the <em>International Labor Organization</em>. Additionally, we are 
        excited to be bringing back the <em>Press Corps</em> where students can explore the use of 
        journalism and its role in international relations. </p>
        <p> Along with this letter, you can find additional information regarding our conference by 
        navigating through our website, bmun.org, which will be updated in the coming months. Thank 
        you for supporting our conference and we hope to see you at BMUN LXIII! </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
