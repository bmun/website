        <hr>

        <p>Dearest Advisors and Delegates,</p>
        <p>It is with the distinct honor and pleasure that I formally invite you to the 64th annual session of Berkeley Model United Nations (BMUN) to be held from <strong>March 4th to 6th, 2016</strong> on the prestigious University of California, Berkeley campus.</p>
        <p>Berkeley Model United Nations made history in 1952 when it launched the first ever Model United Nations simulation in the world. Since then, BMUN has consistently strived to create an educational environment where high school students from all around the world had the opportunity to engage in constructive debate and critical thinking through a diverse array of international topics chosen by our Secretariat. We, the Secretariat, serve as the facilitators. The Secretariat consists of UC Berkeley undergraduate majors who share in this passion for international relations, but it is truly through and because of the students themselves that BMUN has been able to put out the high quality of debate expected of it in the past sixty-four years.</p>
        <p>As a non-profit organization, we seek to serve our community by making model UN accessible and affordable to all students. This year, we hope to serve even more students, not just through our annual conference but also through our <strong>Outreach</strong> program, which allows us to conduct workshops with local high schools and provide materials for schools to teach their students how to participate in MUN. To ensure that no student is excluded from participating in BMUN due to financial limitations, we have also boosted our <strong>Alumni Scholarship</strong> to $7,000, increasing ever more by the day as we dedicate all of the funds generated through our <strong>AmazonSmile</strong> donations.</p>
        <p>BMUN 64 seeks to embark on new levels this year. We will be returning to <strong>Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union</strong> for many of our conference facilities. We will also be offering <strong>19 dynamic committees</strong>, spanning a diverse array of the most pressing international issues, both from historical and contemporary times. As always, we will be hosting our traditional General Assembly and ECOSOC committees. But this year, we will also be featuring innovative new committees such as the THIMUN-style Arab League, the bilingual Mandarin-English Chinese State Council, the bilingual Spanish-English Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, a crisis Tudor Courtl, and the Berkeley Venture Capital, where delegates will have the opportunity to pitch and collaborate on various startup ideas. We are happy to announce that we will also be continuing our Press Corps where students can explore the use of journalism and its role in international relations.</p>
        <p>Along with this letter, you can find additional information regarding our conference by navigating through our website, bmun.org, which will be updated in the coming months.</p>
        <p>We invite you all to again make history with us this coming spring. Thank you for supporting our conference, and we hope to see you at BMUN LXIV! </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
